# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my current Archlinux installation. This replaces my old i3wm nord configuration (and is way simpler).

I'm using Hyprland with the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) color palette.

As I don't have as much time as I had during the first COVID lockdown, it's mostly configs taken from the internet and adapted to my needs.
I mainly use configs provided from the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) GitHub organization and [waybar-updates](https://github.com/savely-krasovsky/waybar-updates).
